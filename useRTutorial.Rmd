# Introduction to APIs:

Types of APIs:

- REST API: read/modify a user's account: HTTP request (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to  communicate between client and server (e.g. Authorization, Accept, Content-Type).
- Streaming API: read data to deliver in real-time.

### Before you start

The general procedure for working with social media data includes the following steps:

**Step 0** 

- Be clear what you want to achieve: e.g. investigate the market landscape, measure reach of your social media campaigns, spy on competitors, see if your new product will be a success. 

- Identify social media platforms  and measurements you will use 

- Identify variables that you will use and approaches you will employ (sentiment analysis? topic modeling? image recognition?)

**Step 1**

- learn about platform's specific requirements in relation to data collection, privacy and data management

- setup developer's access to the platform (optional with some R packages, like `RTweet`)

- learn about the platform's API. You may most likely be using a ready-made R package, but knowing available capabilities is a must. 
Why?

Social media rules change too quickly and your perfect R package may not work suddenly. To fix this quickly you need to know what happened. 
Be ware! Platform may not tell you about changes done and announce them only after!

**Step 2**
Setting up your developers access and collecting data:

### 1. Twitter

#### Setting up Twitter developer account

Applying for Twitter Developer access takes time and require approval (approx. 24 hrs wait).

The step-by-step procedure is available [here](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html)
**The tutorial will use `RTweet`package that has a pre-build Twitter app and does not require an individual Twitter Developer account.

Types of access:

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Twitter Developer access types", out.width=300}
knitr::include_graphics("image/TwitterPremiumAPIs.gif")
```

* Standard APIs: Free! testing, posting to Twitter and get data not available in high volumes.

* [Premium APIs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/premium-apis.html): upgrade to scales access 
- more Tweets per request
- higher rate limits
- more complex queries
- metadata enrichments (e.g. profile geo information), etc

* [Enterprise APIs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/twitters-enterprise-api-suite.html)
- real-time and historical social data
- customized with predictable pricing

** Recent developments and guidelines - Twitter Developer Labs**

[Twitter Developer Labs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/labs) was launched in May 2019 (after a long break!) to provide access to pre-release APIs to test and experiment. [Feedback](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev) is welcomed.

Particular interest APIs:

- [GET /Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/overview)
- [GET /Users](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/overview)
- [Real-time streaming access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/guides/connecting.html)

Available APIs include REST API and Streaming API

Let's have a close look at [Twitter data and text analytics](Twitter.Rmd)

### 2. Facebook/Instagram

The documentation is confusing here as there are two product:

- [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api) (business)

- [Instagram Platform API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/?fbclid=IwAR0IMJ0vgBtaPSt-Nku61u_lLMEHqQLUTPy-WeDCkRkiKEnBny18niodjmc) (non-business, depricated)

Working with Facebook/Instagram requires approval: [App Review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review).

Before you start your application process, you need to have:

- An [Instagram Business Account](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522?fbclid=IwAR31qowUhq_XsheZTPspxf5IeeW_P2h7MY8fWqW7TGgngpDyuOWzjhWpDkM) or [Instagram Creator Account](https://help.instagram.com/1158274571010880?fbclid=IwAR3KzglcALAzAVDa2dd_bICd_XlgA3dkaU0RDuPyhoVS6eao1NjdrQ-C5xk)

- [A Facebook Page connected](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/overview#pages) to that account. To create your Facebook developer account, you need to use your "normal" Facebook account and create a developer account [here](https://developers.facebook.com/) 

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Creating Facebook Developer account", out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("image/createDeveloper.png")
```

- A Facebook Developer account that can perform [Tasks on that Page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/overview#tasks)

- A [registered Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps#register) with Basic settings configured

Please note that [this guidance](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) for Instagram API is deprecated. While it may work in some instances, it is not the way that Facebook/Instagram expect developers to access data. The suggested way is to use [new Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/).


#### Instagram side: Set Up and linking a Business Account on Instagram

1. Download the Instagram app smartphone / tablets / computers through the Apple iOS, Google Play, and Windows app stores. Note that some mobile features are not available / require plug-ins to work for desktops or regular web browsers.

2. if you do not have an Instagram account, create one

- Either sign up with your email address or phone number, and then enter a username, OR

- if you have a Facebook account, log in using it and link the accounts.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Registering Instagram account", out.width=300}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/inst1.png")
```

3. Сonvert to a Business account and connect to Facebook

Tap Settings -> Account -> Switch to Business Account.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Switching to Business Account", out.width=150}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/instb1.png")
```
#### Facebook side: 

Click through the promo slideshow until you get a prompt to connect to Facebook -> Choose a page -> and set the page to “public.”

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=150}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/instb2.png")
```

4. Set permissions to manage your Facebook page

Select the Facebook business page you created and make sure that you are an admin on the account, otherwise will not have access

5. Complete the profile setup and business page
Enter an email, phone number, and address for your business (at least one of them needs to be there)

A new graph icon should appear at the top of the Instagram app. This is your Insights page, where you can keep track of promotions and engagement stats.

At any time, you can go back to the profile page and switch back to a personal account.

If you haven’t already created a Facebook business page, you can do this at the same time. When you get the option to choose a page, select “Create one” at the bottom of the screen.

Set a title for your page, inncluding business category 

6. Create your Facebook developer access 

6.1. Go to developers.facebook.com and create an account there 

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Creating a new Facebook App", out.width=300}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/facebookDev2.png")
```

6.2.Configure Facebook Login

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Configure your Facebook App", out.width=300}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/facebookDev4.png")
```
Add the Facebook Login product to your app in the App Dashboard.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Configure your Facebook App", out.width=300}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/facebookDev5.png")
```

All settings can be left as defaults. Set You can leave all settings on their defaults. Redirect_uri in the Valid OAuth redirect URIs field

App ID: a unique App ID for your app that is included when making any calls to Facebook/Twitter APIs. 

Platform: how your users access your app (e.g R is a server-side application.

Privacy Policy and Terms of Service: URL to a privacy policy and terms of service that apply to your app's users. Lots os online resources to generate a simple one for [free](https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com)

Development Mode: initially your app is in the development mode. It limits app access to users who have a role on your app. You need to do all  of your development and testing in development mode, before you submit your application for review. Note: there is no separate review process for individual products (=platforms )

Important that in development mode your app:

- can use all permissions, features, and products
- can only be installed / used by users who have a role on your app
- can only be granted permissions by users who have a role on your app
- can only access User, Page, or Group data from users who have a role on your app, or data from Test Users and Test Pages.

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width=300}
knitr::include_graphics("image/inst/facebookDev6.png")
```

6.3. Implement Facebook Login

Set up your implementation to request these permissions:

[instagram_basic](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/login-permissions#instagram-basic)
[pages_show_list] (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/login-permissions#pages-show-list)

Now let's have a look what we can do with data from the Instagram. While the actual application requires passing the approval process, we are going to perform preliminary work in R using Instagram Graph API.


### 3. YouTube/Google

If you do not have a Google account, you can create one at https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount 

1. Go to the Google Developers Console https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a project there

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("image/Youtube1.png")
```

2. Enable YouTube APIs:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("image/Youtube2.png")
```

You need to enable the following APIs YouTube Data API is one of the services that your application is registered to use:

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("image/Youtube3.png")
```

In the list of APIs, make sure the status is ON for the YouTube Data API v3.

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("image/Youtube4.png")
```

To use YouTube data API you need to have authorization credentials. 
The API supports API keys and OAuth 2.0 credentials. 

The tuber package uses OAuth 2.0, but you will also need the API keys for some data extraction, e.g. obtaining YouTube channel ID. 

To set up your credentials, you go to the Credentials section in your Google Developers Console. 

For the OAuth 2.0 setup, set “Authorized redirect URIs” as  http://localhost:1410/

Note down the following:

1. Your API key

2. OAuth 2.0 credentials:

Name: useR2019
Client ID:
Client secret:
